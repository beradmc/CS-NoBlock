# NoBlock Plugin

## What Does It Do?

This plugin allows players to pass through each other on your Counter-Strike 2 server. Both teammates and enemy team players can walk through each other.

## Features

- ✅ Works automatically (no commands needed)
- ✅ Works for both enemies and teammates
- ✅ Active for all players including bots
- ✅ Doesn't affect server performance

## Installation

1. Copy the `NoBlock.dll` file to your server's plugins folder:
   ```
   csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins/NoBlock/
   ```

2. Restart your server

3. The plugin will start working automatically

## How It Works

When the plugin loads, it automatically changes collision settings for all players. These settings are reapplied when players spawn or change teams.
